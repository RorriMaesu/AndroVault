Requirements
Python 3.x (download from https://www.python.org/downloads/)
tkinter library (usually included with Python, but installable using pip install tkinter)
pyperclip library (install using pip install pyperclip)
Installation
Download and install Python 3.x from https://www.python.org/downloads/ if you haven't already.
Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the downloaded AndroVault files.
Install the required libraries using the following commands:
Bash
pip install tkinter
pip install pyperclip
Use code with caution.
Usage
Run the script using a terminal window command:
Bash
python password_manager.py
Use code with caution.
The application window will launch.
Enter website details: Provide the website name, email/username, and password in designated fields.

Data Storage (Planned Security Enhancement)
Current Implementation: AndroVault stores website URLs, usernames/email addresses, and passwords in a JSON file named data.json.

Planned Improvement: The data will be encrypted using a secure hashing algorithm in future versions for enhanced protection. It's recommended to keep this file in a secure location and avoid sharing it with others.
